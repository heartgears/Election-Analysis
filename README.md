## Election-Audit Summary
This python script is quite malleable - so long as the elctiond ate input matches that of the input data here, Python will iterate through the data and pull candidate and county vote results. The input data is a little bare - it doesn't include city or precinct data; if that was something an election commission wanted to see however, the code for pullign county results could be duplicated and retrofited to perform this function.
